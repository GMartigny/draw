# drawLib

The easiest to use drawing library.

## How to use

Grab the [drawLib.js file(or drawLib.min.js for a compressed version)](https://api.github.com/repos/GMartigny/drawLib/zipball), slap it to any HTML page and you're good to go.

Check the [quick start guide](https://github.com/GMartigny/drawLib/blob/master/QUICK_START.md) or the [documentations](https://github.com/GMartigny/drawLib/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) for more informations.

You can also take a look at the [examples' folder](https://github.com/GMartigny/drawLib/tree/master/examples).

## Compatibility

For now, drawLib can break other library or script you use. But, it's planned to address that issue in the near future.
